DigiID implementation in PHP
===========================

PHP implementation of [DigiID project/draft](https://github.com/bitid/bitid).

Based on the work of [scintill/php-bitcoin-signature-routines](https://github.com/scintill/php-bitcoin-signature-routines) and using [PHPECC classes](https://github.com/mdanter/phpecc)

**DigiByte Authentication Open Protocol**

Pure DigiByte sites and applications shouldnâ€™t have to rely on artificial identification methods such as usernames and passwords. DigiID is an open protocol allowing simple and secure authentication using public-key cryptography.

Classical password authentication is an insecure process that could be solved with public key cryptography. The problem however is that it theoretically offloads a lot of complexity and responsibility on the user. Managing private keys securely is complex. However this complexity is already being addressed in the Bitcoin ecosystem. So doing public key authentication is practically a free lunch to digibyters.

**The protocol is described on the following BIP draft and is open for discussion :**

Demo
====

http://vps.madriguera.me/bitid-php/ (very basic, be gentle) - **503 Service Temporarily Unavailable now**


Installation
============
* Create a MySQL database, specify database settings in config.php
* Open web site and needed data will be imported automatically


Notes
=====
* I tried to create a flexible library, some  work needs to be done to adapt it to your project

* Pure PHP implementation, no need of **digibyted** (maybe add support for digibyted in the future)

* GMP PHP extension is required (most shared hostings don't have it, another reason to implement digibyted support)

* **isMessageSignatureValidSafe** is the same function as **isMessageSignatureValid** but the later with throw different exceptions on fail, while the former only return true/false (only for lazy programmers that don't handle exceptions)

* By default, it will only allow 1 user by IP to **try** login at the same time (once a user is logged, another user could start the login process), this example could be modify to allow several (no need to modify DigiID)
